						<strong>North Lime Coffee and Donuts</strong> is your favourite hangout for amazing, 
						<strong>freshly roasted coffee</strong> drinks crafted by expert baristas accompanied by <strong>life-changing donuts</strong>.
						
						Why weren't both of these items in the same place before?

						We asked ourselves that same question and decided what must be done.  We wanted coffee that was roasted <strong>right here in Lexington</strong> and donuts that are <strong>made from scratch</strong> with only the finest ingredients.
						You no longer have to worry about going to a bakery and getting a sub-standard coffee drink.  You no longer have to settle for a frozen pastry that was sealed in plastic months ago.
						You know that coming into North Lime means getting the <strong>best of both worlds</strong> from some of the friendliest and most quirky people you'll ever meet.
						We look forward to seeing <strong>you!</strong>
